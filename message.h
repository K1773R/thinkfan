 "\nUsage: thinkfan [-hnqzD [-b BIAS] [-c CONFIG] [-s SECONDS] [-p [SECONDS]]]" \
 "\n -h  This help message" \
 "\n -s  Maximum cycle time in seconds (Integer. Default: 5)" \
 "\n -b  Floating point number (-10 to 30) to control rising temperature" \
 "\n     exaggeration (see README). Default: 5.0" \
 "\n -c  Load different configuration file (default: /etc/thinkfan.conf)" \
 "\n -n  Do not become a daemon and log to terminal" \
 "\n -q  Be quiet (report only important events)" \
 "\n -z  Assume we don't have to worry about resuming when using the sysfs" \
 "\n     interface (see README!)" \
 "\n -p  Use the pulsing-fan workaround (for older Thinkpads). Takes an optional" \
 "\n     floating-point argument (0 ~ 10s) as depulsing duration. Default 0.5s." \
